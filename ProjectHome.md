"Hyper-heuristics can be defined as "methodologies to choose heuristics". There is a growing interest in hyper-heuristics as powerful tools in search and optimisation. A randomly generated initial candidate solution is improved iteratively using a set of low level heuristics in a simple choice hyper-heuristic framework. At each iteration, a given solution passes through two successive stages: heuristic selection and acceptance. The heuristic selection mechanism chooses and applies a low level heuristic to a candidate solution producing a new solution. Then, the acceptance strategy decides whether to continue the search process using the new solution or the one at hand. This project involves in designing and implementing a Java applet (or application) that demonstrates how a choice hyper-heuristic works on an optimisation problem that requires binary representation.
